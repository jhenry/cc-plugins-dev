# EncoderPlus for CumulusClips

This plugin constitutes a series of changes to the encoding workflow for CumulusClips.  These are implemented in a way so as to avoid modifying the core codebase as little as possible.

## Requirements

If you are implementing the queueing functionality, you'll need to ensure access to /var/local/spool/qdaemon/queue/ or something similar.  

## Installation

Something about how to modify upload.ajax.php with the hook/filter call that replaces the encoder command.
